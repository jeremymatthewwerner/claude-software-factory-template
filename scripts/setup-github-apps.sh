# Setup GitHub Apps for the Autonomous Software Factory

# This script guides you through creating GitHub Apps for each agent role.
# Each agent will have its own identity, enabling:
# - Distinct @mentions that trigger workflows
# - Issue assignment to agent accounts
# - Clear audit trail of which agent did what
