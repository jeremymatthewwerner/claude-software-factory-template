# CLAUDE.md - Your Project

Real-time multi-party chat with AI-simulated historical/contemporary thinkers.

## Project Overview
- **Name**: Your Project
- **Description**: Real-time chat with historical philosophers
- **Domain**: https://example.com
- **Hosting**: Railway
- **Maintainer**: @your-github-username

## Repository Setup (One-Time)

**Before the autonomous factory can run without intervention, complete these steps:**

### 1. GitHub App Permissions
Go to **Settings → Actions → General** and grant these permissions to the GitHub App:
- ✅ `workflows` - Allows agents to modify `.github/workflows/` files
- ✅ `contents: write` - Allows agents to push code
- ✅ `issues: write` - Allows agents to create/update issues
- ✅ `pull-requests: write` - Allows agents to create PRs

### 2. Required Labels
Create these labels (or run: `gh label create <name> --color <color>`):
- `ai-ready` (#0E8A16) - Ready for autonomous agent
- `needs-principal-engineer` (#7057FF) - Escalated to Principal Engineer (Code Agent stuck)
- `needs-human` (#D93F0B) - Requires human intervention (PE escalated)
- `qa-agent` (#0052CC) - QA Agent tracking issues
- `automation` (#BFDADC) - Automated by agents
- `ci-failure` (#B60205) - CI failure issues
- `status:bot-working` (#7057FF) - Bot is actively working on this issue
- `status:awaiting-human` (#D93F0B) - Blocked waiting for human input
- `status:awaiting-bot` (#0E8A16) - Human commented, bot will respond
- `bug`, `enhancement`, `priority-high`, `priority-medium`, `priority-low`
- `factory-improvement` (#1D76DB) - Documents factory/workflow fixes for audit trail

### 3. Secrets
Ensure these secrets are set in **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions**:
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` - For Claude API access
- `GITHUB_TOKEN` - Auto-provided, but verify workflow permissions
- `PAT_WITH_WORKFLOW_ACCESS` - Personal Access Token with `workflow` scope (for Code Agent to modify workflows)
- `RAILWAY_TOKEN_SW_FACTORY` - Railway **Project Token** (for CI deploys via `railway redeploy`)
- `RAILWAY_WORKSPACE_TOKEN` - Railway **Workspace Token** (for DevOps GraphQL log fetching)
- `RAILWAY_WORKSPACE_ID` - Railway workspace ID (UUID from Railway dashboard URL)
- `PRODUCTION_BACKEND_URL` - Backend URL for health checks (e.g., `https://api.example.com`)
- `PRODUCTION_FRONTEND_URL` - Frontend URL for health checks (e.g., `https://example.com`)
- `TEST_CLEANUP_SECRET` - Secret for test user cleanup endpoint (used by smoke/canary tests)
- `DEVOPS_API_SECRET` - Secret for DevOps API endpoints (used by DevOps Agent for database maintenance)
- `FEEDBACK_PROCESSOR_SECRET` - Secret for feedback-to-issue conversion (used by DevOps workflow to process user feedback)

### 4. Branch Protection (Optional)
If using branch protection on `main`, ensure:
- Allow GitHub Actions to bypass (for auto-merge)
- Or use admin merge for agent PRs

**Once setup is complete, the factory should run autonomously.**

## Autonomous Software Factory Philosophy

**This repo is designed to run as an autonomous software factory.** The goal is for AI agents to handle routine development tasks without human intervention.

**Key Principles:**
- **Human intervention = factory bug** - If a human needs to step in to fix something, that's a bug in the factory itself, not just a bug in the code
- **Fix the factory, not the symptom** - When intervening, always ask: "How can I prevent needing to intervene for this type of issue again?"
- **Workflow fixes over one-off fixes** - ALWAYS prefer updating workflows/agents to handle issues automatically rather than fixing issues manually. A one-off fix helps once; a workflow fix helps forever.
- **Visibility enables autonomy** - Agents must post progress updates to issues so humans can monitor without intervening
- **Self-healing over manual fixes** - CI failures auto-create issues, agents auto-fix them
- **Immediate triggers over polling** - When possible, use webhooks/events (e.g., `push` to main) to trigger actions immediately rather than waiting for scheduled polls

**When you (human or Claude) intervene:**
1. Fix the immediate issue
2. Update the relevant agent workflow to handle this case autonomously next time
3. Document the improvement in this file
4. **Update the template repo** - Make a generic version of the fix in [claude-software-factory-template](https://github.com/jeremymatthewwerner/claude-software-factory-template) so other projects benefit
5. **Create a closed issue documenting the fix** - File an issue with `factory-improvement` label describing the problem, root cause, and solution. Close it immediately with a reference to the fixing PR. This creates a searchable audit trail of factory learnings.

> **Template Repo:** When improving workflows, CLAUDE.md, or agent behavior, always create a generalized version of the improvement in the template repo at `jeremymatthewwerner/claude-software-factory-template`. This ensures learnings from this project benefit all future projects.

## Decision-Making Autonomy (CRITICAL)

**Agents are empowered to make technical decisions.** Don't ask "Should I do A, B, or C?" - DECIDE.

### When to Decide Autonomously (DO THIS):
- **Implementation approach** - Pick the cleanest solution
- **Test strategy** - Decide what tests are needed
- **Timeout/retry values** - Use reasonable defaults (30s timeout, 3 retries)
- **Dependency versions** - Pin to latest stable
- **Code style** - Follow existing patterns
- **PR merge strategy** - Wait for CI, don't merge with failures
- **Branch management** - Always use feature branches, never push to main

### When to Actually Escalate to Human (RARE):
- **Security decisions** - Credentials, auth changes, API keys
- **Breaking changes** - Public API changes affecting users
- **Business logic** - Product decisions, not technical ones
- **Architecture** - Major system redesign (not refactoring)
- **Cost implications** - New services, paid APIs

### The 10-Minute Rule
If you've been stuck on a DECISION (not implementation) for 10 minutes, MAKE A CHOICE.
Document your reasoning. A reasonable choice made quickly > perfect choice never made.

### Case Study: Issue #84
The Code Agent got stuck and asked: "Should I A) Create new issue, B) Close PR, or C) Merge anyway?"
This was WRONG. It should have DECIDED based on engineering judgment. The Principal Engineer agent
exists to handle cases where the Code Agent gets stuck, taking a holistic approach to fix the
factory rather than just the symptom.

## IMPORTANT Rules

- ALWAYS write tests alongside code (unit, integration, E2E)
- NEVER commit code without tests - minimum 70% coverage (goal: 85%, tracked via QA agent)
- Commit and push frequently at logical checkpoints
- See REQUIREMENTS.md for full product specification
- **ALWAYS check things yourself before asking the user** - Use available tools (CLI, API calls, logs, code inspection) to verify state, configuration, or behavior. Only ask the user to check something if you've confirmed there's no way for you to check it directly.
- **ALWAYS check CI results after every push** - Use `gh run list` and `gh run view <id> --log-failed` to verify CI passes. If CI fails, debug and fix immediately. Do not consider a task complete until CI is green.
- **When resuming work or assessing project state, ALWAYS check CI first** - Run `gh run list` before anything else. There may be failed runs from a previous session that need fixing.
- **ALWAYS check open issues at session start** - Run `gh issue list` and work from highest priority (P0 → P1 → P2). Critical bugs must be addressed before new features.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js (TypeScript strict mode)
- **Backend**: Python / FastAPI
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **LLM**: Claude API
- **Real-time**: WebSockets
- **Deployment**: Railway

## Quality Gates

```bash
# Backend
cd backend
uv run pytest                    # run tests
uv run pytest --cov=app          # run tests with coverage
uv run ruff check .              # lint
uv run ruff format .             # format
uv run mypy .                    # type check
uv run uvicorn app.main:app --reload  # dev server

# Frontend
cd frontend
npm test                         # jest tests
npm run lint                     # eslint
npm run typecheck                # tsc
npm run dev                      # dev server
npx playwright test              # e2e tests

# Full test suite
./scripts/test-all.sh
```

## Development Workflow (MANDATORY)

At every meaningful milestone (new feature, API changes, UI flow completion):

1. **Run all unit tests** - `./scripts/test-all.sh` or run backend/frontend tests separately
2. **Run E2E tests** - `cd frontend && npx playwright test` (with backend running)
3. **Local user testing** - Have user manually test the feature in browser
4. **Fix any issues** - Repeat steps 1-3 until passing
5. **Commit and push** - Only after E2E and manual testing pass

**Why this matters**: Unit tests with mocked APIs won't catch schema mismatches between frontend and backend. E2E tests exercise the real API and catch integration bugs before they reach the user.

**E2E test requirements**:
- Every user-facing flow must have E2E coverage
- Test the happy path AND error cases
- Use real backend (not mocked) to validate actual API contracts

**When E2E tests hang or timeout (CRITICAL)**:
- **DO NOT assume it's a test or framework issue** - E2E tests exercise real code paths
- **ASSUME a real regression** - Something in recent changes broke the functionality
- **Investigate recent commits** - Look at what changed since tests last passed
- **Check the feature being tested** - If a test for "thinker suggestions" hangs, the thinker suggestion code likely has a bug
- **Avoid piling on fixes** - Don't keep adjusting test timeouts or adding workarounds; find and fix the root cause

**E2E Debugging (CI captures server logs)**:
- When E2E tests fail in CI, backend logs are automatically captured
- **Artifacts uploaded:** `/tmp/backend.log`, `test-results/`, `playwright-report/`
- **Logs printed:** Backend logs appear in CI output on failure
- **To debug:** Check the workflow run artifacts and look for API errors, exceptions, or slow responses in backend logs

### Log Analysis Protocol (MANDATORY for agents)

**BEFORE implementing any fix, agents MUST analyze logs.** Don't guess - READ THE ACTUAL ERRORS!

```bash
# Step 1: Check issue comments for "❌ CI Failed" - contains actual logs
gh issue view <ISSUE_NUMBER> --comments

# Step 2: Get workflow logs
gh run list --workflow=ci.yml --limit 5 --json databaseId,headBranch,conclusion
gh run view <RUN_ID> --log-failed

# Step 3: Download E2E artifacts
gh run download <RUN_ID> --name e2e-debug-logs --dir /tmp/e2e-logs
cat /tmp/e2e-logs/backend.log | tail -200
```

**Agents must document what logs showed BEFORE implementing a fix.** Example: "Backend logs show 500 error on /api/thinkers - the query is missing a WHERE clause"

## Testing

- **Backend**: pytest + pytest-asyncio + pytest-cov
- **Frontend**: Jest + React Testing Library
- **E2E**: Playwright
- Coverage minimum: 70% (goal: 85%)

### Test Rigor Protocol (MANDATORY)

**Before implementing any non-trivial feature or change:**
1. **Think deeply about test cases** - Consider what new unit, integration, and E2E tests are needed
2. **Document in TEST_PLAN.md** - Update the test plan document with new test cases before writing code
3. **Consider edge cases** - What could go wrong? What are the boundary conditions?

**After implementing:**
1. **Write tests for all new code** - Don't just test happy paths
2. **Update existing tests** - If behavior changed, tests should change too
3. **Run full test suite** - Verify nothing regressed

### Testing Workflow Changes (CRITICAL)

**Workflow changes need testing just like code changes.** A regex that looks right can fail silently. An API call that seems correct might have wrong permissions.

**Before merging workflow changes:**

1. **Test components locally first:**
   ```bash
   # Test regex patterns against real data
   COMMENT_BODY=$(gh api .../issues/123/comments --jq '...')
   echo "$COMMENT_BODY" | grep -E 'your-pattern' | wc -l

   # Test shell commands
   gh issue list --label "ai-ready" --json number,labels
   ```

2. **Know when a real issue test is required:**
   - Changes to Code Agent trigger conditions (label handling, event types)
   - Changes to progress comment format or update logic
   - Changes to CI monitoring, auto-merge, or auto-close behavior
   - Changes to agent prompts that affect behavior
   - Any change to bug-fix.yml, triage.yml, or principal-engineer.yml

3. **Create a trivial test issue when needed:**
   ```bash
   # Create a minimal test issue
   gh issue create --title "Test: Verify workflow change [describe what]" \
     --body "This is a test issue to verify [specific workflow change].

     Expected behavior: [what should happen]

     Delete this issue after verification." \
     --label "bug" --label "ai-ready"
   ```

4. **Verify the workflow ran correctly:**
   - Check Actions tab for the workflow run
   - Verify progress comments were created/updated
   - Check that labels were applied correctly
   - Confirm the expected behavior occurred

5. **Clean up test issues** - Close or delete after verification

## Code Style

- **Python**: ruff (format + lint + isort), mypy strict
- **TypeScript**: ESLint + Prettier, strict mode

### MANDATORY: Run Formatters and Linters Before Every Commit

**NEVER commit code without running formatters and linters first.** This applies to ALL code changes.

```bash
# Frontend (REQUIRED before every commit that touches frontend/)
cd frontend
npm run format          # Run Prettier to auto-fix formatting
npm run lint -- --fix   # Run ESLint with auto-fix
npm run typecheck       # Verify TypeScript types

# Backend (REQUIRED before every commit that touches backend/)
cd backend
uv run ruff format .    # Auto-format Python code
uv run ruff check . --fix  # Lint and auto-fix Python code
uv run mypy .           # Type check Python code
```

**The workflow is:**
1. Make code changes
2. Run formatters (`npm run format`, `uv run ruff format .`)
3. Run linters with auto-fix (`npm run lint -- --fix`, `uv run ruff check . --fix`)
4. Run type checking (`npm run typecheck`, `uv run mypy .`)
5. If any issues remain, fix them manually
6. THEN commit

## Git Workflow

**Claude Code sessions use feature branches:**
1. Create branch: `claude/<description>-<session-id>` (branch name is auto-assigned)
2. Commit changes with issue references (`Relates to #N` in commit messages)
3. Push to feature branch and create PR
4. CI runs on PR - must pass before merge
5. Merge PR (squash) - triggers deploy
6. Issues auto-close after deploy + smoke tests pass (handled by CI `close-issues` job)

**CRITICAL: Issue Reference Rules (prevents premature closure)**
- **In commit messages:** Use `Relates to #N` (NOT `Fixes #N`)
- **In PR descriptions:** ALWAYS use `Relates to #N` (NEVER use `Fixes #N`)
- **NEVER push directly to main** - Always use a feature branch + PR
- **Why:** GitHub auto-closes issues when `Fixes #N` appears in PR descriptions, but this happens on PR merge - BEFORE the code is deployed to production! We want issues to close only after deploy + smoke tests pass. The CI `close-issues` job handles this automatically.

**Best practices:**
- Commit frequently with clear messages
- One logical change per commit
- Always reference GitHub issues in commits (with `Relates to #N`)

## Commit Format

`<type>(<scope>): <description>` where type is feat|fix|docs|test|chore|ci

## GitHub CLI Setup

The `gh` CLI is required for creating PRs, checking CI, and managing issues.

```bash
# Install gh (if not present)
curl -L https://github.com/cli/cli/releases/download/v2.63.2/gh_2.63.2_linux_amd64.tar.gz -o /tmp/gh.tar.gz
tar -xzf /tmp/gh.tar.gz -C /tmp
sudo mv /tmp/gh_2.63.2_linux_amd64/bin/gh /usr/local/bin/

# Authenticate (required after install)
gh auth login --web --git-protocol https
```

When using `gh` commands, always specify the repo explicitly (the git remote uses a local proxy):
```bash
gh pr create --repo your-org/your-project ...
gh run list --repo your-org/your-project
gh issue list --repo your-org/your-project
```

## Task & Bug Tracking with GitHub Issues

All bugs AND tasks must be tracked via GitHub Issues for audit history and traceability.

### Issue Priority (MANDATORY)

**Always assign a priority label when creating issues:**
- **P0** - Blocks most or all functionality from working (critical bugs, system down)
- **P1** - Blocks some functionality from working correctly, OR new functionality requests
- **P2** - Optimizations, cleanup, refactoring, or minor improvements

### Issue Labels

Use labels to categorize issues:
- `bug` - Something isn't working
- `feature` / `enhancement` - New feature request
- `ai-ready` - Ready for autonomous agent to pick up
- `needs-principal-engineer` - Escalated to PE (Code Agent stuck)
- `needs-human` - Requires human intervention (PE escalated)
- `priority-high`, `priority-medium`, `priority-low`

## Autonomous Agents

This repo uses 8 AI-powered GitHub Actions agents. See `.github/workflows/` and `.claude/agents/` for details.

| Agent | Trigger | Purpose |
|-------|---------|---------|
| **Triage** | Issue opened | Classifies issues, detects duplicates, adds labels |
| **Code Agent** | `ai-ready` + `bug`/`enhancement` labels | Diagnoses and fixes issues, creates PRs |
| **Principal Engineer** | `needs-principal-engineer` label | Holistic debugging, fixes factory not just symptoms |
| **QA** | Nightly 2am UTC | Test quality improvement with daily focus rotation |
| **Release Eng** | Daily 3am UTC | Security audits, dependency updates, CI optimization |
| **DevOps** | Every 5 min + push to main + manual | Health checks, auto-rebase PRs, auto-merge ready PRs, Railway logs, service restarts |
| **Marketing** | On release | Updates changelog, docs |
| **CI Monitor** | On CI failure (main) | Auto-creates `ai-ready` issues for failed builds |

### Escalation Flow

When Code Agent gets stuck (timeout, 3x CI failure), it adds `needs-principal-engineer` label which triggers the **Principal Engineer**:

```
Code Agent stuck → adds needs-principal-engineer → Principal Engineer investigates
                                                           ↓
                                       Analyzes root cause (code? infra? workflow?)
                                                           ↓
                                       Downloads E2E artifacts, reads backend logs
                                                           ↓
                                       Fixes issue AND updates factory to prevent recurrence
                                                           ↓
                                       If truly stuck → adds needs-human → Human reviews
```

**Principal Engineer responsibilities:**
- Take holistic view - fix the factory, not just the symptom
- Download and analyze E2E artifacts (`gh run download`)
- Can modify workflows, CLAUDE.md, agent prompts
- Document learnings to prevent similar issues

### DevOps Agent - Railway Infrastructure Management

The DevOps agent has full Railway CLI access for infrastructure management:

**Manual Triggers (workflow_dispatch):**
| Action | What It Does |
|--------|-------------|
| `incident-response` | Diagnose and fix production issues |
| `view-logs` | Fetch and analyze Railway logs |
| `restart-service` | Redeploy services to recover from issues |
| `manage-variables` | List/set environment variables |
| `provision-infrastructure` | Add databases (postgres, redis) or services |
| `diagnose` | Full diagnostic report of all systems |

**Railway CLI Commands Available:**
```bash
railway logs --service backend      # View service logs
railway redeploy                    # Restart/redeploy service
railway variables                   # List env variables
railway variables --set "KEY=val"   # Set env variable
railway add --database postgres     # Provision new database
railway status                      # Check project status
```

**Required Secrets:**
- `RAILWAY_TOKEN` - Get from Railway dashboard → Account → Tokens (workspace-scoped)
- `RAILWAY_WORKSPACE_ID` - Railway workspace UUID (visible in dashboard URL)
- `PRODUCTION_BACKEND_URL` - For health checks
- `PRODUCTION_FRONTEND_URL` - For health checks

**Inter-Agent Diagnostics:**

Other agents (like Code Agent) can request production diagnostics by commenting `@devops` on issues:
```
@devops please check user logs for authentication errors
@devops check database connection status
@devops check recent backend logs
```

DevOps Agent will query production and post results back to the issue. This enables Code Agent to verify production state when debugging issues without having direct production access.

### DevOps API - Database Access for Agents

The DevOps agent has access to a protected Admin API for database maintenance operations. This enables autonomous cleanup, diagnostics, and data management.

**API Endpoints (require `X-DevOps-Secret` header):**

| Endpoint | Method | Purpose |
|----------|--------|---------|
| `/api/devops/health` | GET | Verify DevOps API authentication |
| `/api/devops/stats` | GET | Database statistics (users, sessions, messages, etc.) |
| `/api/devops/cleanup/stale-sessions` | DELETE | Remove sessions older than N hours |
| `/api/devops/cleanup/orphans` | DELETE | Remove orphaned records (messages without conversations, etc.) |

**Required Secrets:**
- `DEVOPS_API_SECRET` - Secret for authenticating DevOps API calls

**Self-Evolving API Pattern:**

When an agent needs a new database capability not covered by existing endpoints:

1. **Create issue** with `enhancement` + `admin-api` labels describing the need
2. **Implement endpoint** following the pattern in `backend/app/api/devops.py`:
   - Add authentication via `require_devops_secret` dependency
   - Use Pydantic models for request/response schemas
   - Support `dry_run` parameter for destructive operations
   - Log all operations for audit trail
3. **Add tests** for the new endpoint
4. **Update REQUIREMENTS.md** Section 7.2 with the new endpoint
5. **Update this section** to document the new capability

See `REQUIREMENTS.md` Section 7 for full Admin API specification.

### Agent Visibility (IMPORTANT)

All agents MUST post progress updates to their issues for visibility using the **checkbox progress pattern**.

#### Checkbox Progress Pattern

Agents create a progress comment/issue with checkboxes, then **edit that same content** (not post new comments) to check off items as they complete. This provides:
- Real-time visibility into agent progress
- A single place to see status (not scattered across comments)
- Clear indication of what's done and what's pending

**Example Progress Tracker:**
```markdown
## 🤖 Progress Tracker

- [x] 📖 Reading issue and understanding requirements
- [x] 🔍 Analyzing codebase and finding affected files
- [ ] 🛠️ Implementing fix
- [ ] ✅ Running tests and quality checks
- [ ] 📝 Creating PR
- [ ] 🚀 Waiting for CI

**Status:** Implementing fix...
**Workflow:** [View logs](...)

---
### Analysis
**Root Cause:** [discovered issue]
**Files Affected:** [list]
**Proposed Fix:** [plan]
```

Agents update this by editing the comment/issue body via API:
```bash
gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/issues/comments/COMMENT_ID -X PATCH -f body="[updated body]"
```

**Code Agent** creates a progress comment on each issue:
1. Initial: All boxes unchecked, "Starting analysis..."
2. Checks boxes as each step completes
3. Adds Analysis section after analyzing
4. Adds PR link when submitted
5. Monitors CI, auto-merges on success
6. Final: "✅ CI Passed & Merged" → triggers deploy → issue auto-closes

**Full Autonomous Flow:**
```
Issue Created → Triage labels → Code Agent fixes → PR created → CI passes → Auto-merge → Deploy → Issue closes
```

**QA Agent** creates a tracking issue with checkboxes:
1. Creates issue: "🤖 QA Agent: [focus] ([day])" with progress checklist
2. Edits issue body to check boxes and fill in sections
3. Closes issue with PR link when complete

**CI Monitor** triggers Code Agent automatically:
1. Creates issue with `bug`, `priority-high`, `ci-failure` labels
2. Adds `ai-ready` label separately (triggers Code Agent's `labeled` event)
3. Code Agent picks up and attempts fix

### Interacting with the Code Agent

**Comment-driven interaction:** You can comment on any issue with `@claude` to ask questions or provide suggestions. The bot will:
1. Read your comment and the full issue context
2. Think about your question/suggestion
3. Post a thoughtful response
4. Take action if appropriate

**Status labels indicate who should act next:**
| Label | Meaning | Who Acts |
|-------|---------|----------|
| `status:bot-working` | Bot is actively working | Wait for bot |
| `status:awaiting-human` | Bot needs your input | You respond |
| `status:awaiting-bot` | You commented, bot will respond | Wait for bot |
| (no status label) | No active work | Add `ai-ready` to trigger |

**Example workflow:**
1. Issue created with `bug` + `ai-ready` labels
2. Bot starts → `status:bot-working`
3. Bot has a question → `status:awaiting-human` + comment asking
4. You reply with `@claude here's the answer...`
5. Bot responds → `status:bot-working`
6. Bot creates PR → removes status labels

**Concurrency:** Only one bot run per issue at a time. Comments are queued, not dropped.

### Agent-to-Agent Coordination (@mentions)

Agents can request help from other agents using @mentions in issue comments. This is the preferred method for agent coordination because:
- **Comments are immutable** - creates audit trail
- **Each mention is an event** - triggers workflow reliably
- **Simple to understand** - no complex state machine
- **Works regardless of labels** - doesn't depend on ephemeral label state

**Available @mentions:**

| Mention | Triggers | Use Case |
|---------|----------|----------|
| `@claude` | Code Agent | Ask for code changes, bug fixes, feature implementation |
| `@devops` | DevOps Agent | Request production logs, database diagnostics, service restarts |
| `@principal-engineer` | Principal Engineer | Escalate complex issues requiring holistic factory fixes |

**Examples:**
```
@devops please check backend logs for errors in the last hour
@claude the database schema needs updating, please create a migration
@devops check database connection status
```

**When to use @mentions vs labels:**
- **@mentions**: Agent-to-agent requests, re-triggering stuck issues, requesting specific actions
- **Labels**: Initial triage, marking issues as ready for automation (`ai-ready`), escalation states

### QA Agent - Test Quality Guardian

The QA agent performs **periodic reflection and enhancement** of the test suite:

**Daily Focus Rotation:**
- Monday: Coverage Sprint - bring lowest-coverage module up by 15%+
- Tuesday: Flaky Test Hunt - run tests 5x, identify and fix flaky tests
- Wednesday: Integration Test Gaps - add tests for untested API endpoints
- Thursday: E2E Enhancement - add edge case E2E tests (errors, mobile, edge cases)
- Friday: Test Refactoring - improve readability, reduce duplication
- Saturday: Edge Case Analysis - test error paths and boundary conditions
- Sunday: Regression Prevention - add tests for recent bug fixes

**Each run includes:**
1. Coverage analysis (backend + frontend)
2. E2E test completeness review
3. Test sophistication check (edge cases, error paths, race conditions)
4. Creation of meaningful tests (not just coverage padding)
5. **Update TEST_PLAN.md** with descriptions of all new tests added
6. PR with coverage diff and test descriptions

**E2E Enhancement Focus:**
- Empty form submissions, max length inputs, special characters
- Session expiry, network disconnection, concurrent operations
- Mobile-specific behaviors (touch, orientation, viewport)
- Error recovery and state persistence

### Agent Coordination

- All agents read this `CLAUDE.md` for project rules
- Agents update `AGENT_STATE.md` with their progress
- Escalation to @your-github-username when stuck >30min or after 3 CI failures

### Known Limitations (require human intervention)

**Workflow file changes**: The GitHub App cannot modify `.github/workflows/` files due to missing `workflows` permission. When CI fails due to workflow config (like coverage thresholds), a human must update the workflow file.

**To fix**: Grant `workflows` permission to the GitHub App in repo Settings → Actions → General.

## Default Policies (for autonomous decisions)

When agents encounter these situations, apply these defaults instead of asking:

**Coverage threshold unreachable:**
- If coverage is >10% below the required threshold, lower threshold to (current + 5%)
- Create tracking issue for incremental improvement
- Let QA agent gradually increase coverage over time

**Test flakiness:**
- If a test fails intermittently, disable it with `@pytest.mark.skip(reason="flaky - issue #N")`
- Create issue to investigate and fix the root cause
- Don't block CI on flaky tests

**Dependency conflicts:**
- Pin to last known working version
- Create issue for proper resolution
- Don't spend >30min on dependency issues

**Transient CI failures (502, 503, timeouts):**
- CI has retry logic for transient errors (3 attempts with exponential backoff)
- Distinguish transient errors (retry) from real errors (fail fast)
- If smoke test fails due to production blip, it will auto-retry
- See `.github/workflows/ci.yml` smoke-test section for implementation

## Observability & DevOps Hygiene

**See `docs/OBSERVABILITY.md` for full standards.**

Key requirements:
- **Health endpoints**: `/health` (basic) and `/health/ready` (deep with DB check)
- **Four Golden Signals**: Track latency, traffic, errors, saturation
- **Structured logging**: Include timestamp, level, service, request_id
- **Alerting**: P1/P2/P3 severity levels with defined response times

When adding features, always consider:
- [ ] Health endpoint updated if new dependencies added
- [ ] Key operations logged at INFO level
- [ ] Errors logged with full context
- [ ] Metrics added for new endpoints
- [ ] Failure scenarios have alerts

## Escalation

Assign to @your-github-username when:
- Stuck >30min
- CI fails 3x on same issue
- Needs architecture decision (not covered by default policies)
- Security concern

## Architecture

- Thinker agents run as independent async tasks (concurrent responses)
- Conversation only progresses when user has chat window open
- Agents resume automatically when user returns to chat
