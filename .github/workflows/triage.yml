            Triage issue #${{ steps.issue.outputs.number }}:
            1. Get issue details: gh issue view ${{ steps.issue.outputs.number }}
            2. Check for duplicates: gh issue list --search "similar terms"
            3. Classify as bug, feature/enhancement, or question
            4. Assign priority: P0 (critical), P1 (high), P2 (medium)
            5. Add classification and priority labels: gh issue edit ${{ steps.issue.outputs.number }} --add-label "bug,priority-low" (or enhancement, priority-high, etc.)
            6. **INTELLIGENT ROUTING**: Determine which agent should handle this issue based on content:

            ## Agent Routing Rules

            **Route to @factory-manager if the issue mentions:**
            - Workflow problems (workflow, agent, triage, factory, CI/CD pipeline)
            - Agent coordination issues (bot stuck, agent not triggering, escalation problems)
            - Factory meta issues (how the autonomous factory works)

            **Route to @devops if the issue mentions:**
            - Infrastructure (railway, deploy, deployment, logs, database, production)
            - Service health (health check, uptime, monitoring, incident)
            - Environment variables or secrets management

            **Route to @code for everything else:**
            - Bug fixes (application bugs, errors, crashes)
            - Feature requests (new functionality)
            - Code changes (refactoring, optimization)
            - Test issues (test failures, coverage - @code handles with @qa support)

            7. Post your triage assessment with the APPROPRIATE @mention:
               gh issue comment ${{ steps.issue.outputs.number }} --body "## 🤖 Triage Assessment

            **Classification:** Bug/Enhancement
            **Priority:** High/Medium/Low (P1/P2/P3)
            **Status:** Ready for [agent type]

            *Auto-triaged by Triage Agent*"

            IMPORTANT:
            - Use EXACTLY ONE @mention in "Next Steps" - the appropriate agent for the issue type
            - @factory-manager for workflow/agent/factory issues
            - @devops for infrastructure/deployment/production issues
            - @code for bugs, features, and code changes (DEFAULT)
            - Do NOT add 'ai-ready' label anymore - the @mention triggers the agent

            Available labels: bug, enhancement, priority-high, priority-medium, priority-low, needs-human
