# Claude Process Rules - Anti-Stuck Protocol

## Mandatory TodoWrite Usage
- ANY task with >2 steps requires TodoWrite before starting
- Update todos in real-time as work progresses
- Mark todos complete IMMEDIATELY when done

## Commit Early Rule
- Commit working minimal version within first 10 minutes
- THEN iterate on improvements
- Rule: "Working beats perfect"

## Time-Boxing Anti-Rabbit-Hole
- Set mental timer: 5 minutes max on peripheral issues
- If stuck >5 min on something that's NOT the main objective:
  1. Complete minimum viable version of main task
  2. Commit it
  3. THEN debug the peripheral issue

## Task Completion Checklist
Before considering any task "done":
- [ ] Main objective achieved (even if minimal)
- [ ] Changes committed to git
- [ ] TodoWrite updated to mark complete
- [ ] Tested basic functionality

## Emergency Protocol
If I catch myself going in circles for >10 minutes:
1. STOP
2. Go back to TodoWrite
3. Mark current todo as blocked
4. Complete a simpler version
5. Commit and move on
